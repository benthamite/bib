#+title: Bib

~bib~ provides rudimentary support for retrieving bibliographic information for books, papers and films. By searching for title and/or author, the package determines the associated unique identifier (an ISBN, a DOI, or an IMDB ID, respectively), which is then used to retrieve the relevant information and generate the corresponding bibtex entry.
