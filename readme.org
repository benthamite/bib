* About

=bib= provides a handful of conveniences for quickly retrieving bibliographic metadata for books, academic papers and films from within Emacs. Given only a title (and optionally an author), the package searches the relevant public APIs, picks the correct unique identifier (ISBN, DOI, IMDb / Letterboxd slug) and returns a ready-to-paste BibTeX entry or URL.

This is *not* a full-featured reference manager—just a small personal tool that I decided to publish because others might find it useful. Adjust your expectations accordingly.

* Installation

* Usage

The following interactive commands can be invoked via =M-x= or bound to keys of your choice:

| Command                        | Description                                       |
|--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
| =bib-search-crossref=            | Query Crossref for a DOI                          |
| =bib-search-isbn=                | Query ISBNdb for an ISBN                          |
| =bib-search-imdb=                | Query OMDb for an IMDb ID                         |
| =bib-search-letterboxd=          | Query Letterboxd for the film slug / URL          |
| =bib-zotra-add-entry-from-title= | Create a BibTeX entry via *zotra* once an ID exists |
| =bib-libgen=                     | Search Library Genesis and download a file        |

* API keys

Set these variables (e.g. in your init file or via customize) if you have the corresponding service keys:

- =bib-isbndb-key= :: ISBNdb key
- =bib-omdb-key=   :: OMDb key
- =bib-tmdb-key=   :: TMDb key (only for title translation)

The commands that depend on an unset key will gracefully fail.

* Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; store downloaded PDFs here
(setopt bib-downloads-dir "~/Downloads/")

;; prefer Letterboxd slugs instead of full URLs
(setopt bib-letterboxd-use-slug-p t)
#+end_src

See each command’s docstring for further options.
